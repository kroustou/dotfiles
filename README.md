#dotfiles
My setup.

## i3wm
I have installed i3blocks and i3gaps (even though i dont use them).


### i3lock
i3 lock is used by my 'lock' script in order to generate blured images with a locked icon in the middle,
so it should be added in $PATH.

### rofi
I am using rofi as app launcher

### Font Awesome
Also Font Awesome icons are required

## Sublime text 3
I have also added my sublime configuration.

# ToDo
Write some scripts in order to automatically set up my desktop, even in a new setup.
